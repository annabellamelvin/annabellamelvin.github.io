         Description: Although Bronx Park is best known as the site of the Bronx Zoo and New York Botanical
         Garden, the park also contains one of the few natural streamside landscapes remaining
         in the city. The Bronx River, which begins in North White Plains and flows into the
         East River at Soundview Park, offers numerous scenic and recreational opportunities,
         and is an ecologically important habitat for a diverse assemblage of invertebrates,
         fish, and birds. The two-mile stretch of river in Bronx Park runs through a deep gorge,
         where a combination of red maple-hardwood swamp and floodplain forest grows on the
         riverbanks. &#xD;
         &#xD;
         A red maple-hardwood swamp occurs in poorly drained depressions, usually on inorganic
         soils. It can include a broad range of landscapes, including permanently flooded forest
         and apparent upland forests, which are flooded only a few weeks of the year. Varying
         mixes of red maple (Acer rubrum), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), pin oak (Quercus
         palustris), and tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica) dominate these sites. Floodplain forests
         grow on mineral soils in the lowlands of river floodplains and deltas. These areas
         are characterized by their flooding schedule: low areas are annually flooded in spring,
         and high areas are flooded irregularly. Typical floodplain forest tree species include
         silver maple (Acer saccharinum), white ash (Fraxinus americana), cottonwood (Populus
         deltoides), black willow (Salix nigra), and American linden (Tilia americana). &#xD;
         &#xD;
         The floodplain forest, as of Labor Day 2004, is in the midst of a major restoration
         project. The river bed itself is being modified to re-create the floods which give
         rise to the floodplain forest. And Japanese knotweed, an invasive plant that  had
         taken hold of almost all of the riverbanks is being removed. Banks are being stabilized
         with coir logs staked in with live willows and dogwood. The logs are made from a bio-degradable
         material that maintains its integrity long enough for the water-loving trees to take
         hold, at which time they do the job of holding bank soil in place. This project was
         funded by the New York State Clean Water/Clean Air Bond Act and Environmental Protection
         Fund, and the City of New York, and is complemented by the parallel construction of
         the Bronx Greenway which will go through the newly restored river and floodplain landscape.&#xD;
