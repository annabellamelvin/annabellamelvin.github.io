         Description: The Staten Island Greenbelt is a monument of natural resource preservation in a rapidly
         developing environment.  With the exception of High Rock Park, the woodlands of the
         Greenbelt are relatively young but support a great diversity of plants and wildlife.
         Along the Greenbelt Trail are many small wetlands that provide critical habitat for
         amphibians.  The forests in the Greenbelt range from red maple-sweetgum swamp forests
         to upland oak woods.  Variations in topography, geology, and native soil types support
         a great diversity of plants including NYS listed rare plants and many native plants
         that cannot be propagated due to their complex association with soil fungi.  The only
         way to preserve native orchids, ground pines, and other plants with these special
         requirements is to preserve their habitat.
