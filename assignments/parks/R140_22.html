         Description:  Islington Park (also know as Kingfisher Park) is a 23-acre green space that features
         a small pond and associated wetland, with abundant bird life. The park is a wildlife
         oasis, home to a large variety of ecosystems. A successional meadow, once a farmer’s
         field or a shallow pond, has been slowly changing over the last two centuries into
         a climax forest, which contains oak, hickory, and beech trees, as well as an under-story
         of red maple (Acer rubrum), silky dogwood (Cornus amomum), and black cherry trees
         (Prunus serotina). The term “climax forest” refers to a forest that has reached the
         final stage in its evolution. The individual trees may grow, change, or die, but the
         species make-up of the forest remains the same. A forest that is still in succession
         may undergo more material changes as one species crowds out or overshadows another.

         The pond in Islington Park is home to frogs, turtles, catfish, sonnies, and carp.
         In 1999, wildlife enthusiasts counted 35 distinct species of birds in the park. In
         addition to belted kingfisher (Ceryle alcyon), glossy ibis (Plegadis falcinellus),
         great egret (Ardea alba), snowy egrets (Egretta thula), and several species of heron
         can also be found using the park's wetlands.  Freshwater wetlands provide resting,
         breeding, and feeding grounds for hundreds of thousands of migrating birds. Many of
         these birds arrive in New York City only twice a year as they travel along the Atlantic
         flyway, a major migratory route.
