         Description: In 1987, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation designated Eibs
         Pond and the surrounding area as protected wetlands. Two years later, it became a
         New York City park.  Eibs Pond Preserve is located on the serpentine ridge that forms
         the bedrock spine of Staten Island.  Serpentine bedrock is associated with unusual
         plant communities in the very few locations it occurs, which in North America only
         includes Maryland, Virginia, California, and Staten Island.  &#xD;
         &#xD;
         Eibs Pond lies below rolling hills covered by blue stem grass with sweeping views
         of the Verazzano Bridge and the harbor.  The clay-bottomed pond itself covers three
         acres, making it the largest kettle pond in New York City. Kettle depressions formed
         from glacial activity occurring 15,000 years ago. Because the only source of water
         for the pond is rain and runoff, the water level can vary significantly from season
         to season and year to year. The resulting variety of plant and animal life is quite
         impressive. The pond is fringed by a cattail (Typha) and arrow arum (Peltandra virginica)
         marsh, and bulrushes (Scirpus), cinnamon fern (Osmunda cinnamomea), sassafras (Sassafrass
         albidum), and fragrant water lilies (Nymphaea odorata) all thrive here. Snowy egrets
         (Egretta thula), bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus), large-mouth bass (Micropterus
         dolomieu), painted turtles (Chrysemys picta picta), and muskrats (Ondatra zibethica)
         all live in or use the pond. &#xD;
         &#xD;
         Starting in late June, visitors to Eibs Pond Park can often enjoy a glimpse of monarch
         butterflies (Danaus plexippus) as they travel through the city.  The monarch butterfly
         lay their eggs on milkweed (Asclepiadaceae) plants and die, entrusting their offspring
         to fend for themselves.  As the larvae gorge themselves on the milkweed leaves, they
         accumulate the milkweedâ€™s toxic cardiac glycosides and become poisonous to birds and
         other predators.  Monarch butterflies from New York City begin migration in September
         and travel as much as 2,100 miles to reach their winter destination in central Mexico,
         in the state of Michoacan, by the end of October.&#xD;
