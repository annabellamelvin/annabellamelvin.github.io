         Description: The Shorakapok Preserve in Inwood Hill Park is a quiet retreat in Manhattan, with
         some of the only natural forest and salt marsh left on the island as well as unique
         glacial geological formations. The majority of the park is a thick deciduous forest,
         with hiking and nature trails curving up the hill. The forest is home to impressive
         geological features, such as potholes. Much like the irksome potholes in city streets,
         natural potholes are depressions formed in rock as a result of glacial melting. “Indian”
         caves, which are natural rock overhangs once used as shelter by Native Americans,
         can also be found here. Inwood Hill Park is home to the last remaining salt marsh
         in Manhattan. Though small, this marsh is significant as a reminder of the extensive
         salt marshes that once surrounded the island.&#xD;
         &#xD;
         Inwood Park’s forests contains mature red oak and some of the largest tulip trees
         in the City. Much of the park stretches along dry hills whose slopes support a diversity
         of trees and a herbaceous understory.  There is also a rich, moist valley between
         two rock ridges called The Clove. During the early spring, the valley is covered in
         wildflowers, which are able to thrive before the thick canopy is filled. Some of these
         wildflowers include downy yellow violet, bloodroot and Dutchman’s breeches. The forest
         is also home to over 150 species of birds, including hairy woodpeckers and black-capped
         chickadees. The salt marsh is a good location for viewing waterfowl, including great
         blue herons, great and snowy egrets, and belted kingfishers.&#xD;
         &#xD;
         Forests in the city are subject to many disturbances. Flash flooding incidents are
         frequent due to the high proportion of paved surface, and high water velocities lead
         to soil erosion which can eventually undercut trees. In addition, if left un-checked
         invasive plants, which have either escaped from cultivation or have been brought over
         accidentally from other continents, disrupt the ecological balance of the forest.
         Trees such as the Norway maple,  leaf out earlier than native trees, and grow faster.
         Their dense canopy eventually prevents the growth of any other plant. The bare soil
         underneath these trees inevitably erodes. Erosion causes further environmental problems
         such as non-point pollution, where pollutants from our city streets is washed out
         to the rivers and ocean. To help alleviate these issues, the Parks Department’s Natural
         Resources Group has a forest restoration team detailed to the parks of northern Manhattan,
         and Inwood Hill serves as the basis for operation. Throughout the past five years
         Inwood has benefited from hundreds of thousands of grant dollars in support of invasive
         species removal and native species planting, as well as the prevention of soil erosion.
         Grant funding for these projects has come from the New York State Clean Water/Clean
         Air Bond Act and Environmental Protection Fund, and the National Fish and Wildlife
         Foundation.&#xD;
