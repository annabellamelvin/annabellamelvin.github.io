         Description: Most of Arden Heights Woods is a forested hardwood swamp, and is the largest wetlands
         that the Department of Environmental Conservation has classified anywhere in the New
         York metropolitan area. It contains several kettle ponds which are connected by an
         intricate network of streams and creeks. As such, it provides natural flood control
         for the area, making a more complicated (and expensive) man-made sewage system unnecessary.

         &#xD;
         The forests throughout the property are called successional forests. This is because
         they undergo a multi-stage lifecycle, beginning as open fields and maturing into hardwood
         forests. In the mature, or climax, portions of these forests live a multitude of trees,
         including hemlocks (Tsuga canadensis), black cherry (Prunus serotina), and persimmons
         (Diospyros). Perhaps most interesting of all the species present is the eastern white
         pine (Pinus strobus). During the early colonial period, wood from these trees was
         used for masts by the British Navy. The wood is five times lighter than white oak
         (Quercus alba), and therefore more suitable for seagoing vessels. This natural resource
         helped establish Staten Island as a maritime community early in its history. &#xD;
         &#xD;
         In the swamps, there are two particularly notable species of plant life. The first,
         blue flags iris (Iris veriscolor) blooms from May through July, with its namesake
         violet blue flowers. These plants can be recognized by their sword-like leaves even
         when not in bloom. The second, the common reeds, or phragmites, are members of the
         grass family. They thrive in both brackish and fresh water marshes, and can grow to
         be 12 feet tall. Phragmites often invade wetlands at the expense of other native marsh
         plants. &#xD;
         &#xD;
         Many owls frequent this site, including the screech owl (Otus asio), saw whet owl
         (Aegolius acadicus), great horned owl (Bubo virginianus), and the barn owl (Tyto alba).
         Occasionally, a barred owl (Strix varia) from the south will venture this far north.
         This bird is known as the “Southern Gentleman” because it makes the distinct sound
         suggestive of “who cooks for you, who cooks for you-all.” Bats come here for shelter
         and food, and the swamp’s ample insect population helps satisfy their appetite; in
         one year, the average bat consumes fifty times its body weight in insects.
