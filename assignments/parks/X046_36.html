         Description: Seton Falls Park contains a thriving wetland as well as a forest largely undisturbed
         since the American Revolution. Together these ecosystems provide habitat to over 30
         species of bird. Floodplain forest is present along Rattlesnake Creek, as are cattail
         marsh and sedge meadow, at the bottom of a sheer, rocky ravine. Floodplain forests
         grow on mineral soils in the lowlands of river floodplains and deltas. These areas
         are characterized by their flood regime: low areas are annually flooded in spring
         and high areas are flooded irregularly. Above the ravine, oak-hickory and successional
         forests are dominant. Oak-hickory forests occur on well-drained sites, often on ridge
         tops, upper slopes, or south and west facing slopes. &#xD;
         &#xD;
         To address areas of the park that had fallen victim to human disturbance, the Parks
         Department’s Natural Resources Group completed a four-acre forest and wetland restoration
         project in the Spring of 2004. Invasive plants had dominated the southern wetland
         area of Rattlesnake Creek, and the surrounding forest. A monoculture of common reed
         ( Phragmites australis) was excavated and replaced by an area of open water fringed
         by diverse wetland plantings. The forest slopes were rid of invasive trees and vines,
         the slopes were secured with erosion control textiles, and replanted with native forest
         trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants. This project was funded by the New York State
         Clean Water/Clean Air Bond Act and the City of New York.&#xD;
         &#xD;
         A “haven” for wolves and rattlesnakes when Europeans first settled, today Seton Falls
         Park is home to a plethora of more benign animals including salamanders, dragonflies,
         chipmunks, tree frogs, swifts, hawks, thrushes, wood peckers, and butterflies. The
         monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) is frequently seen at Seton Park’s lawn. Despite
         their frail appearance, these butterflies endure a long and perilous migration thousands
         of miles south to Mexico each year to escape the harsh winters of the North. &#xD;
