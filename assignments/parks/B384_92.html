         Description: Fresh Creek winds gently for half a mile along small salt marsh islands of the Jamaica
         Bay ecosystem.  Of this park’s 56 acres, 42 are open water. Along with neighboring
         Four Sparrow Marsh and Spring Creek Park, the salt marsh at Fresh Creek Park helps
         protect the Jamaica Bay ecosystem by acting as a natural filtration system, trapping
         pollutants that would otherwise contaminate the bay. &#xD;
         &#xD;
         The invasive plants common reed (Phragmites australis), mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris),
         and (Ailanthus altissima) cover the uplands in Fresh Creek Park, though noteworthy
         plants such as rock sandwort (Arenaura stricta), Faber’s foxtail (Setaria faberi),
         and velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti) are interspersed throughout.
