         Description: Saw Mill Creek Marsh Preserve contains the largest expanse of remaining salt marsh
         along Staten Island’s west shore. The marshlands on the western side of Staten Island
         were created by the receding of the Wisconsin Glacier 15,000 years ago and the slow
         accumulation of sediment and organic soil.  Saw Mill Creek Marsh was named after the
         brackish creek that carves through the park and empties into the Arthur Kill River
         behind Prall’s Island. &#xD;
         &#xD;
         Saw Mill Creek Marsh is large enough to sustain breeding populations of sharp-tailed
         (Ammodramus caudacutus), seaside (Ammodramus maritimus), and swamp sparrows (Melospiza
         georgiana), and wintering northern harriers (Circus cyaneus), and short-eared owls
         (Asio flammeus).  The park is a favorite spot for many other birds such as egrets,
         herons, and birds of prey including falcons and turkey vultures (Cathartes aura).
         Mammals that inhabit Saw Mill Creek Marsh include white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus),
         muskrat (Ondatra zibethica), Eastern cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus), and
         raccoons (Procyon lotor).&#xD;
         &#xD;
         Fragments of young forest border the marsh and contain New York State listed rare
         plants, including several oak hybrids and a large clone of persimmon.  The upland
         patch of maritime oak woods located at the park is especially uncommon because most
         of these patches were destroyed as salt marshes were filled.
