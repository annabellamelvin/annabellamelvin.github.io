         Description: In the midst of a developed residential area, this 30-acre inlet off of Little Neck
         Bay is an important preserve and habitat area for northeastern Queens.  The preserve
         was formed in 1972 to save precious wetlands and forest from the increasing development.
         On the salt marsh of Udalls Park Preserve, clapper rails (Rallus longirostris) stalk
         silently through the salt grasses. Snowy egrets (Egretta thula) carefully wade through
         the calm waters and osprey (Pandion haliaetus) dive for fish. &#xD;
         &#xD;
         Aurora Pond is located in the middle of the preserve, its placid waters alive with
         dragonflies (Odonata spp.) and wood ducks (Aix sponsa). Raccoons (Procyon lotor) also
         hunt along the edges. Common reed (Phragmites australis) lines the brackish inlet
         known as Gablerâ€™s Creek, which flows into Little Neck Bay. Wooded uplands of silver
         maple (Acer saccharinum), black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), and box elder (Acer
         negundo) are scattered about The Cove.
