         Description: &lt;p&gt;Blue Heron Park is named after the gray-feathered predatory bird with a yellow
         bill, the great blue heron (&lt;i&gt;Ardea herodias&lt;/i&gt;), which can be found throughout
         much of the New York area. Reaching more than four feet in height, it can typically
         be spotted standing at the edge of a pond or marsh, watching for fish or frogs. These
         animals make up their main diet, though they will also eat small mammals, reptiles,
         and smaller birds on occasion. Most herons migrate south in the fall, and those that
         remain in the north often fall victim to severe weather.                        &#xD;
         &#xD;
         &lt;p&gt;The City acquired this parkland in several segments between 1974 and 2001. By the
         time of its official dedication on October 22, 1996, a handful of concerned Staten
         Islanders had been working to preserve and protect the land for a full 33 years. Over
         time, their efforts were rewarded with the interest and hard work of many of their
         fellow residents and many Parks officials. Blue Heron Park has become an outstanding
         wildlife sanctuary and educational resource. The years have seen it transformed from
         a wasteland filled with over 30 abandoned cars to a peaceful refuge of walking trails,
         meadows, ponds, streams, and woodlands. Visitors walking along any of the three main
         trails of the park will find an impressive array of wildflowers, including Wild columbine
         (&lt;i&gt;Aquilegia canadensis&lt;/i&gt;), Black-eyed Susan (&lt;i&gt;Redbeckia hirta&lt;/i&gt;) and Jack-in-the-pulpit
         (&lt;i&gt;Arisaema triphyllum&lt;/i&gt;). &#xD;
         &#xD;
         &lt;p&gt;The park also holds six ponds, among them the 1.75-acre Spring Pond and the 1.4-acre
         Blue Heron Pond, crossed by a popular footbridge. These kettle ponds were formed 15,000
         years ago by the retreating Wisconsin glacier. Today they are teeming with marine
         life such as the curve-billed glossy ibis (&lt;i&gt;Plegadis falcinellus&lt;/i&gt;), the black-crowned
         night heron (&lt;i&gt;Nycticorax nycticorax&lt;/i&gt;), wood duck (&lt;i&gt;Aix sponsa&lt;/i&gt;), owls (&lt;i&gt;Strigiformes&lt;/i&gt;),
         osprey (&lt;i&gt;Pandion haliaetus&lt;/i&gt;), turtles (&lt;i&gt;Chelonia&lt;/i&gt;), and white water lilies
         (&lt;i&gt;Nymphaea odorata&lt;/i&gt;). Spring peepers (&lt;i&gt;Pseudacris crucifer&lt;/i&gt;) and tree frogs
         (&lt;i&gt;Hylidae&lt;/i&gt;) find ample breeding grounds in the ponds, where nature enthusiasts
         flock to observe the thriving ecosystem.
