         Description: Long before Europeans settled this land on the southernmost tip of Staten Island,
         there was a strong Native American association with this site. The Lene Lenape Indians
         used this area, particularly the bluff, as a seasonal settlement. They traveled up
         and down the East Coast from the New York Harbor to the Delaware River basin, oystering,
         fishing, hunting, and trading. At one time, animals such as deer, turkeys, heath hen,
         black bears, beavers, wolves, red and gray foxes were plentiful in this region. &#xD;
         &#xD;
         Today, there is still a variety of life to see when visiting the park.  Every May
         and June, horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus) emerge from the Arthur Kill and Raritan
         Bay onto the beaches of Conference House Park. The horseshoe crab has been around
         since before the dinosaurs, roughly 1.2 billion years, and is referred to as a “living
         fossil”.  Female horseshoe crabs arrive on the beaches to lay their eggs, with their
         male counterparts grasped onto the back of the female’s shell.  Two weeks later the
         eggs are ready to hatch and the water sweeps the newborns into the sea. The thousands
         of protein-rich eggs provide a feast for hungry migrating birds, which can eat enough
         to double or even triple their body weight before moving on. &#xD;
         &#xD;
         Starting in late June, visitors to the south-facing shorelines of Conference House
         Park can often enjoy a glimpse of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) as they travel
         through the city.  The monarch butterfly lay their eggs on milkweed (Asclepiadaceae)
         plants and die, entrusting their offspring to fend for themselves.  As the larvae
         gorge themselves on the milkweed leaves, they accumulate the milkweed’s toxic cardiac
         glycosides and become poisonous to birds and other predators.  Monarch butterflies
         from New York City begin migration in September and travel as much as 2,100 miles
         to reach their winter destination in central Mexico, in the state of Michoacan, by
         the end of October. &#xD;
         &#xD;
         One of the most common sights in the park are common reeds, or phragmites, a member
         of the grass family. They thrive in both brackish and fresh water marshes, and can
         grow to be 12 feet tall.  Phragmites often invade wetlands at the expense of other
         native marsh plants. &#xD;
