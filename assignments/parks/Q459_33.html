         Description: Dubos Point was a saltwater marsh until 1912, at which point it was filled with dredged
         materials for real estate development. The project failed to materialize and the site
         then reverted to a more natural state. Now, the site is the largest salt marsh on
         the north shore of the Rockaway peninsula east of Rockaway Point.  Marsh interior
         species including sharp-tailed and seaside sparrow, and willet nest here.  Upland
         grassland and maritime shrubland provide nesting habitat for diamondback terrapins,
         Fowler’s toad, and black-crowned night heron.  The Merlin and Peregrine Falcon, both
         endangered species, have been seen on Dubos. &#xD;
         &#xD;
         The 33-acre Dubos Point Wildlife Sanctuary is named to honor two environmentalists
         Dr. Rene (1901-1982) and his wife Jean Dubos (1918-1988). As advisor to the United
         Nations Conference on the Human Environment (1972), Rene Dubos coined the phrase “Think
         Globally, Act Locally.” Rene Dubos died in 1982 and was survived by Jean, who was
         the moving force behind the formation of this sanctuary. Its creation corresponds
         with the Dubos’ vision of global environmentalism achieved through local action.
