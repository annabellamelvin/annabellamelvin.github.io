         Description: The William T. Davis Wildlife refuge was the first designated wildlife preserve in
         New York.  In 1928, William T. Davis (a renowned naturalist and entomologist) and
         the Audubon Society successfully secured 52 acres as a wildlife and bird sanctuary
         which has grown through various acquisitions to the almost 430 acres it is today.
         The refuge is remarkably diverse, containing broad expanses of salt meadow fringed
         by low marsh, forested uplands, rock outcrops, a swamp forest, and small, spring-fed
         ponds.  The variety of habitat is reflected by abundant birdlife.  &#xD;
         &#xD;
         More than 117 bird species have been recorded at the William T. Davis Wildlife Refuge,
         including sharp-tailed sparrow (Ammodramus caudacutus), wood duck (Aix sponsa), and
         several species of herons, egrets, ibis, and cormorants. Hawks and owls can also be
         seen here, especially in winter.  Barn (Tyto alba), great horned (Bubo virginianus),
         and short-eared (Asio flammeus) owls hunt in the refuge by night.  Red-tailed (Buteo
         jamaicensis), red-shouldered (Buteo lineatus), and rough-legged (Buteo lagopus) hawks
         hunt by day.  Marsh hawks (Circus cyaneus) patrol at dawn and dusk.  On the ground
         and in the water, snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina), fiddler crabs (Uca), and
         muskrats (Ondatra zibethica) can be seen throughout the site.
