         Description: &lt;p&gt;Alley Pond Park is the second largest park in Queens at 635 acres. The site is
         named for The Alley, an 18th century commercial and manufacturing center formerly
         located here. The park lies on a glacier-formed moraine, a ridge of sand and rock
         that formed 15,000 years ago, marking the southern terminus of the Minnesota Ice Sheet.
         The glacier dropped the boulders that sit on the hillsides of the southern end of
         the park and left buried chunks of ice that melted and formed the ponds dispersed
         throughout the valley, called “Kettle Ponds.” Fresh water drains into the valley from
         the hills and bubbles up from natural springs, mixing with the salt water from Little
         Neck Bay. As a result, the park is host to freshwater and saltwater wetlands, tidal
         flats, meadows, and forests, creating a diverse ecosystem and supporting abundant
         bird life. &#xD;
         &#xD;
         &lt;p&gt;The tulip trees, oaks, and beeches in Alley Pond Park’s forest are some of the
         largest in the City, including the largest tulip tree on Long Island. Locally- and
         state-rare plants include bloodroot, Christmas fern, pink lady’s slipper, ginat yellow
         hyssop, and others.  The kettle ponds and other small wooded wetlands support the
         City’s best remaining populations of spotted and two-lined salamanders, wood frog,
         spring peeper, and gray tree frog.&#xD;
         &#xD;
         &lt;p&gt;In 1998, ospreys nested in the park for the first time since the 1920s, on a platform
         erected in the Little Neck Bay salt marsh.  Ospreys may also be seen diving for fish
         in the lake at Van Cortlandt Park and in Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx. &#xD;
