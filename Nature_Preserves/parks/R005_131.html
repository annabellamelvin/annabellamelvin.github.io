      <p><b>Park Name: </b>Clove Lake Park Preserve
      </p>
      <p><b>Park ID: </b>R005
      </p>
      <p><b>Borough: </b>Staten Island
      </p>
      <p><b>Acres: </b>131
      </p>
      <p><b>Description: </b>Clove Lakes Park derives its name from the Dutch word “kloven,” meaning cleft. The
         particular cleft is the valley and brook between Emerson and Grymes Hills. This valley
         was deepened by the glacier 20,000 years ago. The brook which ran through the valley
         originated in Clove Swamp and ran to the Kill Van Kull. The damming of this brook
         over the years created the different lakes and ponds in the area.&#xD;
         &#xD;
         The northwest section of the park is home to Staten Island’s largest living thing,
         a tulip tree (Liriodendron tulipifera). One-hundred-and-seven-feet tall and at least
         three hundred years old, this tree survived the extensive logging and clearing which
         occurred when the settlers came. Tulip Trees are known for their straight trunks from
         which Native Americans carved canoes. &#xD;
         &#xD;
         Also of interest in Clove Lakes Park are the outcroppings of serpentine rock at the
         crest of the hills. The spine of Staten Island is a broad ridge of serpentine, which
         was formed during the Ordovician period (435-500 million years ago) when heat and
         pressure altered rocks rich in magnesium and iron. Ash green in color, serpentine
         is named after the patterns in the rock that resemble snake skin. Its mineral composition
         includes fibrous chrysotile (known commercially as asbestos), talc, oluvine (green
         lava grains) as well as ferromagnesia, a mineral containing magnesium and iron.  &#xD;
