      <p><b>Park Name: </b>Deer Park Preserve
      </p>
      <p><b>Park ID: </b>R115
      </p>
      <p><b>Borough: </b>Staten Island
      </p>
      <p><b>Acres: </b>40
      </p>
      <p><b>Description: </b>Kettle holes, steep hills and large boulders in Deere Park are marks of glacial movement
         from the last Ice Age, which ended about 12,000 years ago. The variety of soils deposited
         during the glacier’s passage allowed a diversity of plant and animal species to inhabit
         the region. Today, these areas function as resting places for migratory birds. A thick
         oak (Quercus spp.) forest dominates the property, with an undergrowth speckled by
         azaleas and wild blueberries (Vaccinius spp./.) The Blue Trail, one of the four major
         hiking trails of the Staten Island Greenbelt, begins at the entrance located at the
         bottom of Staten Island Boulevard and leads hikers all the way up the hill to one
         of the highest points on the eastern seaboard. <br/><br/>
         Many owls frequent this site, including the screech owl (Otus asio), saw whet owl
         (Aegolius acadicus), great horned owl (Bubo virginianus), and the barn owl (Tyto alba).
         Occasionally, a barred owl (Strix varia) from the south will venture this far north.
         This bird is known as the “Southern Gentleman” because it makes the distinct sound
         suggestive of “who cooks for you, who cooks for you-all.” Bats come here for shelter
         and food, and the swamp’s ample insect population helps satisfy their appetite; in
         one year, the average bat consumes fifty times its body weight in insects.<br/><br/>
