      <p><b>Park Name: </b>Reeds Basket Willow Swamp Preserve
      </p>
      <p><b>Park ID: </b>R118
      </p>
      <p><b>Borough: </b>Staten Island
      </p>
      <p><b>Acres: </b>49
      </p>
      <p><b>Description: </b>Reed’s Basket Willow Swamp Park is a steep wooded site, which slopes down to an open
         swamp.   In 1978, the Reed’s Basket Willow Swamp was designated as a protected freshwater
         wetland by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, ensuring its
         preservation under state law. <br/><br/>
         The upland portion of the swamp is mostly closed canopy beech-oak forest with intact
         native shrub and herb layers that include maple-leaved viburnum (Viburnum acerifolium),
         lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium), and pinkster azalea (Rhododendron periclymenoides).
         These plants are all indicators of mature forest with undisturbed native soils. The
         forest which covers nearly half the area of the park is predominated with young oak
         (Quercus spp.), interspersed with birches (Betula spp.), tulip magnolias (Liriodendron
         tulipifera), hickory (Carya spp.), and chestnut trees (Castanea spp.). Hiking trails,
         such as the yellow trail found on Ocean Terrace at the top of Emerson Court, guide
         explorers through the woods. <br/><br/>
         The swamp is a breeding habitat for dusky (Desmognathus fuscus) and northern red salamanders
         (Pseudotriton ruber), both rare on Staten Island and extirpated from the other four
         boroughs.  A common plant that can be seen in the swamp are common reeds, or phragmites,
         a member of the grass family. They thrive in both brackish and fresh water marshes,
         and can grow to be 12 feet tall.  Phragmites often invade wetlands at the expense
         of other native marsh plants.<br/><br/>
         This park’s unusual name is inspired by the Read family, owners of the land for several
         generations. John Read (1786-1849), started a family tradition when he decided to
         try his luck at basket making, and planted the swampy land around his farm with purple
         willow trees. The willow tree buds every spring, at which point it is at the peak
         condition to be harvested. The sap flowing under the bark makes it easy for farmers
         to peel the bark off the trunk. After the bark has been removed and soaked in water,
         it is cut into strips and woven into the distinctive baskets.
