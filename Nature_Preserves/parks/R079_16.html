      <p><b>Park Name: </b>Lemon Creek Park Preserve
      </p>
      <p><b>Park ID: </b>R079
      </p>
      <p><b>Borough: </b>Staten Island
      </p>
      <p><b>Acres: </b>16
      </p>
      <p><b>Description: </b>Lemon Creek Preserve contains the largest and most pristine salt marsh on Staten Island’s
         south shore.  The marsh is contiguous with a larger expanse of state-owned marsh north
         of Hylan Boulevard.  Steep forested slopes rise on either side of the marsh.  The
         forest protects the marsh by preventing erosion and sediment deposition from the slopes
         into the marsh.  A freshwater pond, only 100 feet from Raritan Bay, is adjacent to
         the only purple martin (Progne subis) colony in New York City.  These gregarious birds
         nest in apartment-house-style structures maintained by volunteers.&#xD;
         &#xD;
         Lemon Creek is fed from a watershed that begins two-and-one-half miles from the creek.
         The main source is a small freshwater pond near Woodrow Road, known as Porzio’s Pond.
         The water travels over and under ground to Lemon Creek, which carries it down to Prince’s
         Bay, and ultimately to Raritan Bay. The red clay bluffs in the park, reaching 85 feet
         above Prince’s Bay at Mt. Loretto, are part of the harbor hill terminal moraine (a
         ridge or landform marking the farthest advance of a glacier or ice sheet). A glacier
         that receded approximately 15,000 years ago created these bluffs, which are the tallest
         ocean-facing cliffs in New York State. &#xD;
         &#xD;
         Lemon Creek Park’s waterfront area provides a spawning ground for many species of
         fish and shellfish.  Although clamming is now prohibited for pollution reasons, the
         Lemon Creek fishing pier, at the foot of Sharrott Avenue, offers the opportunity to
         cast a line and catch flounder, striped bass, bluefish, weakfish, and others. Every
         May and June, horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus) emerge from the Raritan Bay onto
         the beaches in Lemon Creek Park. Female horseshoe crabs arrive on the beaches to lay
         their eggs, with their male counterparts literally in tow. Males grasp onto the back
         of the female’s shell using their specially adapted, hooked legs, sometimes two, three,
         or four males onto one female. When they arrive on the beach, female horseshoe crabs
         dig a hole in the sand and lay up to 20,000 tiny olive-green eggs inside. The males
         then rush to be the first to fertilize.
