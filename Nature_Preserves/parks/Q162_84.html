      <p><b>Park Name: </b>Rockaway Beach

      <p><b>Description: </b>Every summer in the Arverne neighborhood of Rockaway Beach an area between B44th and
         B57th Streets is cordoned off to limit disturbance to breeding piping plovers. The
         piping plover (Charadrius melodus) is a small, plump shorebird that breeds on Atlantic
         beaches from Newfoundland to Virginia, as well as on inland beaches from eastern Alberta
         and Nebraska east to the shores of Lake Ontario. In 1986 the piping plover was federally
         designated as endangered on the Great Lakes and threatened on the Atlantic Coast.
         Plovers breed on the same sandy beaches that humans enjoy, where they build their
         nest, a slight depression in the sand called a scrape. To keep the eggs cool in the
         hot sun, and warm at night male and female plovers take turns sitting on the scrape.
         When the chicks have hatched, the parents teach them to run back and forth from the
         scrape to the water’s edge, where they eat invertebrates such as marine worms, fly
         larvae, beetles, crustaceans, and mollusks. Human activity is a problem for the birds.
         Even joggers on the beach can accidentally step on the young chicks, or distract the
         adults, leaving the chicks vulnerable.&#xD;
         &#xD;
         Over the last few seasons, "satellite" sites have been established both to the east
         and the west of the primary protected area. NYC Parks’ Wildlife Unit monitors the
         plovers on Rockaway Beach according to the guidelines provided by the U.S. Fish &amp;
         Wildlife Service. Nests are observed at least three times a week, and records are
         kept regarding the number of plovers observed, the number of nesting pairs and the
         number of eggs in a clutch. Observations are usually made from afar using binoculars
         and spotting scopes so as not to disturb the nesting birds. Other species benefiting
         from this protection are least terns, oystercatchers - and an endangered plant, sea
         beach amaranth.
