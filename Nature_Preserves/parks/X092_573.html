      <p><b>Park Name: </b>Van Cortlandt Park Preserve
      </p>
      <p><b>Park ID: </b>X092
      </p>
      <p><b>Borough: </b>Bronx
      </p>
      <p><b>Acres: </b>573
      </p>
      <p><b>Description: </b> Van Cortlandt Park Preserve, the third largest of the Forever Wild Nature Preserves,
         comprises over half of the 1,150-acre park.  The preserve occupies the northern section
         of the park, with four distinct areas: the Northwest and Northeast Forests, the Tibbetts
         Brook/Van Cortlandt Lake, and Vault Hill. Fifteen thousand years ago, the massive
         glaciers covering New York  receded and left behind the characteristic sketch of Van
         Cortlandt Park—steep ridges, smooth hillsides, and open flats—and exposed its three
         major rock components: Fordham Gneiss, Inwood Dolomite, and Manhattan Schist. Among
         the many animals that burrow, nest, feed, and rest in this urban wild, some of the
         most noteworthy are red fox, which have been seen in the hilly forests, and a small
         flock of eatern bluebirds (New York’s state bird) which have been glimpsed crossing
         the Vault Hill meadow.<br/><br/>
         Fordham Gneiss, one of the oldest rock formations on Earth, characterizes Van Cortlandt’s
         dramatic cliffs in the Northwest Forest, the largest forest in the preserve (188 acres).
         This oak-hickory forest grows on rocky heights overlooking valleys dominated by tulip
         trees (Liriodendron tulipifera) and century-old oaks. Ground layer wildflowers are
         extraordinarily diverse in the Northwest Forest. There is bloodroot (Sanguinaria canadensis),
         trout lily (Erythronium americanum), rattlesnake root (Prenantles racemosa), and many
         asters, including heart-leafed aster (Aster divaricatus). The forest contains one
         of the highest concentrations of rare plants in the city, including giant yellow hyssop
         (Agastache neptoides), golden seal (Hydrastis canadensis), and wingstem (Verbesina
         alternifolia). The Northeast Forest contains low-lying, moisture-retaining land ideal
         for sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), red maple (Acer rubrum), and pin oak (Quercus
         palustris). Tibbett’s Brook cuts through soft Inwood marble on its way from Westchester
         to Spuyten Duyvil, and feeds the man made Van Cortlandt Lake. Tibbetts Brook and its
         associated wetlands are a must-see for bird watchers, where predators like barred
         owls (Strix varia) and red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) hunt, and wood ducks (Aix
         sponsa), known for jumping from their high nests soon after hatching, have been sited.
         Meadows are not typically found within the City, Vault Hill boasts one of the prettiest
         and most varied, composed of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), little bluestem (Schizachyrium
         scoparium), and such wildflowers as birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), ironweed
         (Veronia noveboracensis), and sweet white clover (Melilotus alba). This is one of
         the few places in the City where the eastern bluebird (the New York State bird) can
         be seen.<br/><br/>
         To see all of the park’s natural assets walk along one of its many nature trails.
         The Cass Gallagher  (2 miles) serves the Northwest Forest. A narrow belt of lowland
         swamp forest still survives along the Kieran Trail (1.7 miles) around the open water,
         where pin oak (Quercus palustris) and red maple (Acer rubrum) grow above Solomon’s
         seal (Polygonatum biflorum), Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia), marsh
         fern (Thelypteris palustris), and sensitive fern (Onoclea sensibilis). The John Kieran
         (1.7 miles) journeys through the parks’ lake area and freshwater wetlands, and forms
         a loop with the Parade Ground, the John Muir  (1.5 miles) serves the Northwest and
         is Van Cortlandt’s only east-west path, traversing the steep terrain at the park’s
         center. The Putnam and Old Croton Aqueduct Trail are the major north-south trails.
         The Aqueduct Trail in particular provides a wonderful woodland walkway. In this rich
         forest, stands of black walnut (Juglans nigra), American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis),
         and American elm (Ulmus americana) are present, along with sugar maple (Acer saccharum),
         which is native to New England and rarely seen in these parts.
