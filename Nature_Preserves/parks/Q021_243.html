      <p><b>Park Name: </b>Cunningham Park Preserve
      </p>
      <p><b>Park ID: </b>Q021
      </p>
      <p><b>Borough: </b>Queens
      </p>
      <p><b>Acres: </b>243
      </p>
      <p><b>Description: </b>The Forever Wild Preserve in Cunningham Park occupies over two thirds of the park,
         providing 240 acres of forest habitat, vernal pools, and kettle ponds for sensitive
         wildlife.  The Southern Forest, located in the southeastern section of the park is
         one of the most undisturbed natural areas in the City, with a mature growth of red
         (Quercus rubra) and black (Q. velutina) oaks, tulip (Liriodendron tulipifera), and
         hickory (Carya spp.) trees.  The understory is abundant with native wildflowers, flowering
         dogwood (Cornus florida), and a large variety of ferns, such as sensitive (Onoclea
         sensibilis), interrupted (O. claytoniana), and the rare rattlesnake (Botrychium virginianum)
         and maidenhair (Adiantum pedatum).  &#xD;
         &#xD;
         The northern forest was previously farmland, which is still evident by the old stone
         walkways and walls that can be found throughout the forest. The northern forest is
         younger and dominated by tulip trees and flowering dogwood as well as a a lush understory
         dominated by wild sarsaparilla(Aralia nudicaulis/, bellwort (Uvularia spp.), star-of-Bethlehem
         (Ornithogalum umbellatum), and jewelweed(Impatiens capensis).  A third part of the
         preserve is a long, narrow wetland to the southeast of the Southern Forest, home to
         a variety of waterfowl and spring peepers (Hyla crucifer).
