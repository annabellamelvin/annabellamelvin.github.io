      </p>
      <p><b>Park ID: </b>R088

      <p><b>Description: </b>Often referred to as one of the most tranquil places in New York City, High Rock Park
         is noted for its quiet ponds and deep woods.  High Rock Park is one of nine parks
         in Staten Islandâ€™s 2,500 acre Greenbelt and has been recognized as a Natural Environmental
         Education Landmark.&#xD;
         &#xD;
         The variety of habitats, including forests, meadows and freshwater wetlands support
         a diverse array of plants and wildlife. There are six walking trails in the park along
         which visitors can see stands of red maples (Acer rubrum), Highbush blueberries (Vaccinium
         corymbosum) and patches of skunk cabbage (Symplocarpus foetidus). Dense forests of
         red maple, American beech, oaks and hickory prevent much understory plant growth,
         though in the spring, pinxter azalea (Rhododendron canescens) is abundant.  Visitors
         can also view a rare grove of persimmon (Diosyros virginiana), a tree more common
         to the South. &#xD;
         &#xD;
         High Rock Park contains five ponds and various wetlands, including Stump Pond, Hourglass
         Pond, Walker Pond and Loosestrife Swamp.  Wood ducks (Aix sponsa), great blue herons
         (Ardrea herodias), and muskrats (Ondatra zibethica) all make their homes here along
         with hawks, owls, migrating warblers, woodpeckers, frogs and turtles.
