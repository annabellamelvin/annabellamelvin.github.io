      <p><b>Park Name: </b>Central Park Preserve
      </p>
      <p><b>Park ID: </b>M010
      </p>
      <p><b>Borough: </b>Manhattan
      </p>
      <p><b>Acres: </b>34
      </p>
      <p><b>Description: </b>The North Woods is home to the Ravine, the only stream valley in Central Park. The
         Loch, a stream that flows beside the pathway under both bridges, is dammed at several
         places to create cascades. The northwest slope of the Ravine is a true deciduous forest
         of oak, hickory, maple, and ash. The forest floor is covered with leaf litter, deadwood,
         and herbaceous plants, such as white wood aster, Allegheny spurge, and woodland goldenrod.
         From the trail, visitors have a bird's-eye view of the central part of the Loch. Designed
         by Olmsted and Vaux as a long narrow lake ("loch" is the Scottish word for "lake")
         it has over the past century reverted to its pre-Park form as a stream. The thickets
         growing on the islands of accumulated silt attract a wide variety of birds, including
         glossy ibis.  /&#xD;
         &#xD;
         Another birding locale is the tall grass and wildflower meadow on the Ravine's southeastern
         slope. The meadow is at its most glorious in the late summer and fall. Cone flower,
         cup plant, and bee balm mixed in with a variety of goldenrods, asters, and native
         grasses set the hillside ablaze with color./
