      <p><b>Park Name: </b>Idlewild Park Preserve
      </p>
      <p><b>Park ID: </b>Q392
      </p>
      <p><b>Borough: </b>Queens
      </p>
      <p><b>Acres: </b>242
      </p>
      <p><b>Description: </b>Idlewild Park is located northeast of John F. Kennedy International Airport and is
         bounded by Rockaway Boulevard, Springfield Boulevard, and 149th Avenue in Queens County,
         New York.  The Park’s 160 acres contain freshwater and tidal wetlands, woodland, meadow,
         and grassland dune-scrub habitat.  The park contains two meandering tributaries of
         Hook Creek, which feeds into Jamaica Bay.  Much of the marsh habitat around Hook Creek
         is of high quality and is managed for the protection of colonial wading birds, which
         breed locally on rookery islands.  The marsh provides essential habitat for foraging
         by egrets, ibis, and herons, which make up 25% of the northeast Atlantic population.<br/><br/>
         A significant amount of the associated upland is filled historical wetland and restoration
         of the wetlands at Idlewild Park has been ongoing for nearly a decade.  Several joint
         projects between Parks’ Natural Resources Group (NRG) and the New York City Department
         of Environmental Protection have been completed including the restoration of 23 acres
         of woodland, wetland, meadow, and dune-scrub communities (1997 to 1999) and a 3-acre
         tidal wetland and shrubland/grassland restoration project (1999-2003).  A pending
         NRG project to restore additional salt marsh following the excavation of an earthen
         dike and replacement of deteriorated steel culvert pipes is awaiting confirmation
         of funding.
