      <p><b>Description: </b>More than three times the size of Manhattan’s Central Park, Pelham Bay Park is the
         City’s largest park property, including a breathtaking 13-mile saltwater shoreline
         that hugs the Long Island Sound. The Pelham Bay Park Preserves links two Forever Wild
         Nature Preserves – Thomas Pell Wildlife Refuge and Hunter Island Marine Sanctuary.
         This area includes mature oak forest, meadows, salt marsh, and the southernmost outcropping
         of rocky intertidal habitat (a rare community in New York State). More than 400 species
         of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and insects have been spotted in Pelham
         Bay Park. Some of the more elusive and noteworthy include: the clapper rail, a long-billed
         marsh bird the size of a chicken; northern diamondback terrapins, which have been
         sighted in the Hutchinson River during spring; and Amphipoea erepta ryensis /, a moth
         with light reddish-brown fore wings an straw-colored hind wings rediscovered in Goose
         Creek Marsh in 1975, when it was thought to have been extirpated.<br/><br/>
         Nearly 200 acres of salt marsh make Pelham Bay Park the largest assemblage of tidal
         wetlands in the City outside of Jamaica Bay. The three major marshes, fed by Goose
         Creek, the Hutchinson River, and the Lagoon, offer fertile mud flats and salt grasses
         to scores of wildlife. Salt marshes also play a critical role in the support of human
         life, acting as natural filtration systems by trapping pollutants that would otherwise
         contaminate our bays and oceans. Salt marshes have the ability to absorb fertilizers,
         improve water quality, and reduce erosion.<br/><br/>
         In an area where hydrology and soil had been disturbed and the invasive  Phragmites
         australis/ had dominated, the Natural Resources Group (NRG) completed a 3-acre salt
         marsh restoration in Fall of 2000. As one of the 20 most invasive plants in New York
         State, phragmites  (Phragmites australis) /, also known as the common reed or “phrag,”
         have become a ubiquitous part of New York City’s landscape. This aggressive reed outcompetes
         any pre-existing vegetation, leading to thick, choking stands that can grow to 15-feet
         high. Phragmites is considered to be a “cosmopolitan” species – one that grows throughout
         the world – but in recent years it has become particularly invasive, taking over other
         species’ habitats. Overall, phragmites provides poorer nutrition than the plant species
         it replaces. Although the thick strands provide good thermal cover for molting waterfowl,
         most birds do not nest where there is an abundance of phragmites, leading to dwindling
         bird populations. Phragmites adjacent to a salt marsh usually grows above the daily
         tides, limiting fish spawning habitat. NRG re-introduced tidal flow and planted salt
         marsh cordgrass  (Spartina alterniflora) /, which is very salt-tolerant, thereby restricting
         Phragmites /growth. This project was funded by the New York State Clean Water/Clean
         Air Bond Act and the City of New York. <br/><br/>
