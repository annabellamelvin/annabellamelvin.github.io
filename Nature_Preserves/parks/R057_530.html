      <p><b>Park Name: </b>Marine Park Preserve
      </p>
      <p><b>Park ID: </b>R057
      </p>
      <p><b>Borough: </b>Brooklyn
      </p>
      <p><b>Acres: </b>530
      </p>
      <p><b>Description: </b> Most of the Marine Park Preserve consists of salt marshes and uplands that flank
         Gerritsen Creek, the westernmost freshwater inlet of Jamaica Bay.  Jamaica Bay is
         an 18,000-acre wetland estuary that provides a unique environment for both wildlife
         preservation and urban recreation. Enclosed by the Rockaway Peninsula and protected
         from the Atlantic Ocean, the region currently hosts over 325 species of birds, 50
         species of butterflies, and 100 species of finfish. A favorite stop for migratory
         waterfowl, the area is an integral part of the larger, regional ecosystem. &#xD;
         &#xD;
         Broad expanses of salt marsh, meadows adorned with wildflowers, sand dunes held in
         place by beach plants, and thickets of shrubs and vines dominate the landscape of
         Marine Park. Myrtle warblers (Dendroica coronata), grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus
         savannarum), cotton-tailed rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus), ring-necked pheasants
         (Phasianus colchicus), horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus), and oyster toadfish (Opsanus
         tau) are a small sampling of the animals that inhabit these plant communities and
         live in or around Gerritsen Creek. &#xD;
         &#xD;
         Marine Park’s sheltered creek attracts a wide variety of marsh birds. From June through
         August, clapper rails (Rallus longirostrus) can be heard calling throughout the marsh.
         In winter, freshwater and marine waterfowl find shelter in the creek. Winter visitors
         include greater (Aythya marila) and lesser (Aythya affinis) scaup, ruddy duck (Oxyura
         jamaicensis), mute swan (Cignus olor), Canada goose (Branta canadensis), and common
         loon (Gavia immer). &#xD;
         &#xD;
         Marine Park provides some prime habitat for one of nature’s most skillful hunters:
         the osprey. The osprey (Pandion haliaetus) will plummet from up to 150 feet in the
         air and execute dramatic feet-first diving attacks on live fish.  They are distinguishable
         by their brown backs, wings, and tails, white undersides, and distinctive brown stripe
         running across their heads. These large birds also build large nests and are known
         to nest in both natural areas, such as trees, and man-made areas, such as on light-posts
         and flat nesting platforms.
