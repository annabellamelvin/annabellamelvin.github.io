      <p><b>Park Name: </b>Pralls Island Harbor Herons Preserve
      </p>
      <p><b>Park ID: </b>R122
      </p>
      <p><b>Borough: </b>Staten Island
      </p>
      <p><b>Acres: </b>74
      </p>
      <p><b>Description: </b>The isolation of Prall’s Island makes it an ideal protected habitat for nesting wading
         birds. During the late 1970s, development ideas were proposed for the island. However,
         bird watchers had begun to recognize the significance of Prall’s Island as a bird
         sanctuary. After a number of herons were seen on the island, further studies revealed
         that several species of birds, including egrets and ibis, were breeding in the area.
         These discoveries put an end to any discussion of developing the island. Along with
         Shooters Island and the Isle of Meadows, Prall’s Island is part of the Harbor Heron’s
         Wildlife Refuge.&#xD;
         &#xD;
         The island was assigned to Parks by the Department of General Services in 1984, to
         be preserved as a wildlife refuge. The New York Audubon Society has a 30-year lease,
         which dates back to 1985, which allows the use of  Prall’s Island for educational
         and scientific purposes. A study of avian life is being conducted by the Audubon Society
         and the Manomet Observatory in Massachusetts. Scientists are monitoring nesting sites
         and studying the habits and diets of migratory birds. The Audubon Society has documented
         400 pairs of nesting birds on the island.&#xD;
         &#xD;
         Without a stable nesting area, birds such as the little blue heron (Egretta caerulea),
         black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), and yellow-crowned night heron
         (Nyctanassa violacea) would not thrive in the New York Harbor. A 1995 survey by the
         New York City Audubon Society documented that the harbor herons area supported 57%
         of the state's cattle egrets (Bubulcus ibis), 21% of the state's great egrets (Ardea
         albus), 28% of the state's snowy egrets (Egretta thula), 57% of the state's black-crowned
         night herons, and 35% of the state's glossy Ibis (Plegadis falcinellus).
