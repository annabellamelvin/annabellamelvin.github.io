      <p><b>Park Name: </b>Pelham Bay Park
      </p>
      <p><b>Park ID: </b>X039
      </p>
      <p><b>Borough: </b>Bronx
      </p>
      <p><b>Acres: </b>138
      </p>
      <p><b>Description: </b>Located north of Orchard Beach, the Hunter Island Marine Zoology and Geology Sanctuary
         takes in all of Twin Islands, Cat Briar Island, Two Trees Island, and the northeastern
         shoreline of Hunter Island. It contains many noteworthy geological features including
         glacial erratics, large boulders that were deposited during the last ice age nearly
         15,000 years ago. The rocky coast of Twin Islands, reminiscent of the New England
         shorefront, is the southernmost outcropping of Hartland Schist, the major bedrock
         component of such coastlines. The sanctuary supports a unique intertidal marine ecosystem
         that is rare in New York State. &#xD;
         &#xD;
         In 1963, the City began landfill operations near this area on Tallapoosa Point in
         Pelham Bay Park. In 1966, plans were made to expand this landfill, which would have
         created the Cityâ€™s second-largest refuse disposal site next to Fresh Kills in Staten
         Island. These plans were met with widespread community opposition led by Councilmember
         Mario Merola, later Bronx District Attorney. The struggle resulted in the creation
         of the sanctuaries by a local law, signed by Mayor John V. Lindsay on October 11,
         1967.&#xD;
