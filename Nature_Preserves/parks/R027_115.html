      <p><b>Park Name: </b>Long Pond Park Preserve
      </p>
      <p><b>Park ID: </b>R027
      </p>
      <p><b>Borough: </b>Staten Island
      </p>
      <p><b>Acres: </b>115
      </p>
      <p><b>Description: </b>Long Pond Preserve combines a variety of habitats, from upland oak-beech woods, to
         swamp forests, bogs, and vernal ponds. Long Pond, protected from pollution by the
         surrounded forest, provides open water habitat for waterfowl, fish, reptiles, and
         amphibians.  This preserve is the only location in the city in which the pickerel
         frog (Rana palustris) has been observed.  Long Pond Park is contiguous with the northern
         Mount Loretto Woodlands, and both areas combined are potentially large enough to provide
         safe breeding habitat for forest interior birds. The park provides an important stop
         on the Atlantic flyway for migrating birds as well as being a place of respite and
         recreation for many people.  Mature beech, oak and hickory woodlands provide much
         of the foliage in the park, with many of the trees over sixty years old. They help
         to support an understory layer of spicebush (Lindera benzoin), blueberry (Vaccinium
         spp.) and many herbaceous plants.&#xD;
         &#xD;
         Long Pond’s history stretches back for thousands of years, beginning with the Wisconsin
         Ice Sheet. Twelve to fifteen thousand years ago, a huge sheet of ice blanketed the
         area, hundreds of feet thick. The pressure of the ice caused depressions in sections
         that had weak underlying rock layers. As the ice receded, these sunken areas formed
         wetlands such as Long Pond and Pam’s Pond. As a result, areas of stronger underlying
         rock were left above sea level. This topographical feature, known as “knob and kettle&amp;Alpha;terrain,”
         can be seen throughout much of Staten Island. The extreme southern and southeastern
         portions of the island were not covered by the Wisconsin Ice Sheet and therefore do
         not exhibit this type of terrain. &#xD;
         &#xD;
         Long Pond and other bodies of water in the park have been incorporated into the Bluebelt
         water drainage system by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection.
         Encompassing several parcels of state-protected wetlands on the island’s south shore,
         the Bluebelt system was specifically designed to provide storm water drainage for
         the neighboring communities.
