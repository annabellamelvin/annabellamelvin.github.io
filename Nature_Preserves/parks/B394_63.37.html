      <p><b>Park Name: </b>Four Sparrow Marsh Preserve
      </p>
      <p><b>Park ID: </b>B394
      </p>
      <p><b>Borough: </b>Brooklyn
      </p>
      <p><b>Acres: </b>63.37
      </p>
      <p><b>Description: </b>Named by naturalists Ron and Jean Bourque, Four Sparrow Marsh Preserve is home to
         four native species that require undisturbed marshland for nesting: Sharp-tailed (Ammodramus
         caudacutus), Seaside (Ammodramus maritimus), Swamp (Melospiza georgiana), and Song
         Sparrows (Melospiza melodia). Because of its relative isolation from residential areas
         in Brooklyn, Four Sparrow Marsh Preserve has been allowed to remain in a fairly natural
         condition. This makes it ideal for many permanently nesting species, including several
         types of ducks, gulls, wading and woodland birds, as well as for the common seashore
         mollusks and crustaceans which those birds feed on. Rare birds are often sited in
         the grassy salt marsh, including bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus ), common snipe (Gallinago
         gallinago ) and little blue heron. (Egretta caerulea ).<br/><br/>
         As the larger and older of the two remaining salt marshes on the north shore of the
         Jamaica Bay estuary system, Four Sparrow Marsh serves two critical roles besides nesting
         habitat.  It is a rest stop for up to 326 species of migrating birds on the Atlantic
         Flyway, and acts as a “kidney”, filtering pollution and excess nutrients from the
         Bay.  Four Sparrow Marsh Preserve contains several types of habitats besides salt
         marsh, including low brush; deciduous forest consisting mainly of cherry, elm, locust,
         poplar, sumac, and willow; open meadow; intertidal mudflat; and high clusters of reed
         species. The open meadow is largely covered with mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris/, an
         aggressive, exotic species common in landfilled areas. <br/><br/>
         In the spring of 2004, Parks’ Natural Resources Group completed a three acre salt
         marsh restoration project at Four Sparrow Marsh.  The restoration project included
         restoring tidal flow to previously filled areas and planting salt marsh cordgrass
         (Spartina alterniflora).  One acre of adjacent woodlands, which serve as an important
         buffer to the marsh, were also restored.
