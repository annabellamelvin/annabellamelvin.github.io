      <p><b>Park Name: </b>Isle of Meadows Preserve
      </p>
      <p><b>Park ID: </b>R152
      </p>
      <p><b>Borough: </b>Staten Island
      </p>
      <p><b>Acres: </b>100

      <p><b>Description: </b>Isle Of Meadows is located at the mouth of the Fresh Kills Estuary where it empties
         into the Arthur Kill.  Along with Prall’s and Shooters Islands, Isle of Meadows is
         part of the Harbor Heron’s Wildlife Refuge.  This natural area provides important
         nesting habitat for the once declining populations of herons, ibis, and egrets in
         the New York Harbor Estuary. Without a stable nesting area birds such as the little
         blue heron (Egretta caerulea), black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax),
         and yellow-crowned night heron (Nyctanassa violacea) would not thrive in the New York
         Harbor. A 1995 survey by the New York City Audubon Society documented that the harbor
         herons area supported 57% of the state's cattle egrets (Bubulcus ibis), 21% of the
         state's great egrets (Ardea albus), 28% of the state's snowy egrets (Egretta thula),
         57% of the state's black-crowned night herons, and 35% of the state's glossy Ibis
         (Plegadis falcinellus).
