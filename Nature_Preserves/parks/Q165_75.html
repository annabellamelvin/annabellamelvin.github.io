      <p><b>Park Name: </b>Spring Creek Park Preserve
      </p>
      <p><b>Park ID: </b>Q165

      <p><b>Borough: </b>Queens

      <p><b>Description: </b>Spring Creek Park Preserve is the largest undeveloped salt marsh in northern Jamaica
         Bay, and runs between Queens and Brooklyn.  Along with several other parks in the
         area, such as Four Sparrow, Marine Park, and Fresh Creek Park, it plays a vital role
         in the protection and preservation of Jamaica Bay.  The Park’s large salt marsh supports
         a variety of wildlife, including great blue herons (Ardea herodias), red-winged blackbirds
         (Agelaius phoeniceus), and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), as well as animals such
         raccoons (Procyon lotor) and muskrats (Ondatra zibethica). The broad salt marsh at
         the creek’s outlet also provides good foraging ground for diamondback terrapins (Malaclemys
         terrapin). Fields of mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) with ailanthus (Ailanthus altissima)
         and scattered common reed (Phragmites australis) also blanket the landfilled terrain.
