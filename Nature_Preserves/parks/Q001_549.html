      <p><b>Park Name: </b>Alley Pond Park Preserve
      </p>
      <p><b>Park ID: </b>Q001

      <p><b>Description: </b>Alley Pond Park is the second largest park in Queens at 635 acres. The site is named
         for The Alley, an 18th century commercial and manufacturing center formerly located
         here. The park lies on a glacier-formed moraine, a ridge of sand and rock that formed
         15,000 years ago, marking the southern terminus of the Minnesota Ice Sheet. The glacier
         dropped the boulders that sit on the hillsides of the southern end of the park and
         left buried chunks of ice that melted and formed the ponds dispersed throughout the
         valley, called “Kettle Ponds.” Fresh water drains into the valley from the hills and
         bubbles up from natural springs, mixing with the salt water from Little Neck Bay.
         As a result, the park is host to freshwater and saltwater wetlands, tidal flats, meadows,
         and forests, creating a diverse ecosystem and supporting abundant bird life.<br/><br/>
         The tulip trees, oaks, and beeches in Alley Pond Park’s forest are some of the largest
         in the City, including the largest tulip tree on Long Island. Locally- and state-rare
         plants include bloodroot, Christmas fern, pink lady’s slipper, ginat yellow hyssop,
         and others.  The kettle ponds and other small wooded wetlands support the City’s best
         remaining populations of spotted and two-lined salamanders, wood frog, spring peeper,
         and gray tree frog.<br/><br/>
         In 1998, ospreys nested in the park for the first time since the 1920s, on a platform
         erected in the Little Neck Bay salt marsh.  Ospreys may also be seen diving for fish
         in the lake at Van Cortlandt Park and in Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx.<br/><br/>
