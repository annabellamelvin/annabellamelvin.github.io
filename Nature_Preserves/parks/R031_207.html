      <p><b>Park Name: </b>Wolfe's Pond Park Preserve
      </p>
      <p><b>Park ID: </b>R031
      </p>
      <p><b>Borough: </b>Staten Island
      </p>
      <p><b>Acres: </b>207
      </p>
      <p><b>Description: </b>Wolfe’s Pond Park contains mature upland woods, swamp forest, open marsh, ponds, and
         shoreline on Raritan Bay, making it one of the most diverse parks in the city.  This
         large park is a refuge for scores of native plants and animals in a rapidly developing
         area of the city.  The beach is part of the shoreline strand that runs continuously
         from Ward’s Point in Conference House Park, north through Mount Loretto and Lemon
         Creek Preserve, to Wolfe’s Pond Park.  &#xD;
         &#xD;
         <br/>The land beneath Wolfe’s Pond Park was carved during the last ice age.  The melting
         Wisconsin ice sheet transported clay, sand, and gravel south and deposited them along
         the shores of Staten Island, forming the beach at Wolfe’s Pond Park. The freshwater
         Wolfe’s Pond was once a tidal inlet, but the gradual action of wind and waves pushed
         sand and clay into the mouth of the inlet, damming it and forming a pond. Wolf’s Pond
         is connected by a stream to Acme Pond, which was formed as the ice sheet retreated,
         leaving a large chunk of ice behind.  This ice melting to form a permanent depression
         filled with water: a kettle pond. &#xD;
         &#xD;
         <br/>Every May and June, horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus) emerge from the Raritan Bay
         to breed on the beaches of Wolf’s Pond Park.  In the spring, common yellowthroats
         (Geothylpis trichas), redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla), and other warblers forage in
         the thickets at the pond edge and in the surrounding forest. Wood ducks (Aix sponsa)
         and mallards (Anas platyrhychos) feed and nest among aquatic plants such as arrow
         arum (Peltandra virginica), swamp rose mallow (Hibiscus moscheutos), and buttonbush
         (Cephalanthus occidentalis). Red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) are conspicuous
         members of the pond community. Black-crowned night herons (Nycticorax nycticorax),
         great blue herons (Ardea herodias), and belted kingfisher (Ceryle alcyon) hunt for
         fish and frogs along the pond edge. &#xD;
         &#xD;
         <br/>The edges of Acme Pond are less disturbed than Wolfe’s Pond because they have been
         protected by swampy conditions. This allows skunk cabbage (Symplocarpus foetidus),
         tussock sedge (Carex stricta), and cinnamon fern (Osmunda cinnamomea) to grow.  Opossums
         (Didelphis marsupialis) and raccoons (Procyon lotor) roam the wood and forage around
         the edges of the pond.  A variety of reptiles, amphibians and fish also reside at
         Acme Pond, including painted turtles (Chrysemys picta), snapping turtles (Chelydra
         serpentina), red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) and several types of bass
         and carp.
