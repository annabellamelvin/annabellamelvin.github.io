      <p><b>Park Name: </b>Riverdale Park
      </p>
      <p><b>Park ID: </b>X142
      </p>
      <p><b>Borough: </b>Bronx
      </p>
      <p><b>Acres: </b>112
      </p>
      <p><b>Description: </b>Riverdale Park Preserve is known for its secluded beauty, thick woods, spectacular
         views of the Palisades along the Hudson, and as a haven for birds. Twenty-seven species,
         including the screech owl (Otus asio), have been confirmed as breeding in the park.
         The bedrock of Riverdale is billion-year-old Fordham gneiss, the oldest rock formation
         in New York City. On top of the gneiss, lies Inwood marble, which was once quarried
         in Riverdale for the production of lime. Remains of two lime kilns stand in the park
         today. <br/><br/>
         Riverdale contains about 50 forested acres, including mature oak-hickory forest, a
         forest that occurs on well-drained sites, often on ridge tops, upper slopes, or south
         and west facing slopes. Composed mainly of five species of oak with black birch and
         hickory, the woods are on their way to becoming a mature or "climax" forest â€“ a forest
         whose shade-tolerant seedlings will survive beneath their parents. Red oak is most
         common here, identifiable by its bristle-tipped leaves and vertically striped bark.
         Other oaks include black, chestnut, white, and the water-favoring pin oak growing
         further downslope.<br/><br/>
         Although probably every area of Riverdale Park has been cleared at one time or another,
         the southern part is covered by the same type of forest that existed in pre-colonial
         times, where tulip trees as tall as 110-feet rise from the slopes of the ravine. Red
         oaks, black birch, black cherry, and hickory are scattered throughout the canopy.
         At the end of the ravine, a small grove of witch hazel grows on the eroded bluffs
         overlooking the Hudson. In the spring, woodland wildflowers like jack-in-the-pulpit,
         bloodroot, and blue violet bloom along the shaded path. Later in summer, spikenard,
         blue-stemmed goldenrod, and joe-pye weed flower as well.<br/><br/>
         The Alderbrook wetland and surrounding forest have benefited from a Natural Resources
         Group restoration project, funded by the New York State Clean Water Clean Air Bond
         Act, Environmental Protection Fund, and the City. Prior to the restoration, the wetland
         was clogged by sediment from the Alderbrook stream and compacted soil around the railroad
         tracks. Stands of invasive mugwort and Japanese knotweed seven-feet high had crowded
         out other vegetation. The restoration re-created the stream channel and open water
         area, and replaced invasive forest vegetation with native. Breeding birds found in
         this area include yellow warblers and common yellowthroats, both of whom nest in the
         dense shrubbery.<br/><br/>
         Easy access to the Hudson River makes the path to the Alderbrook wetland one of the
         most heavily used trails in Riverdale Park. However, crossing the tracks is prohibited.
         High speed trains and 700 volts of electricity from Metro-North's third rail make
         crossing the tracks very dangerous.<br/><br/>
         The Raoul Wallenberg Forest is located across the street from Riverdale Park, and
         is named in honor of a Swedish diplomat who is credited with saving tens of thousands
         of Hungarian Jews from likely extermination by the Nazis during World War II. This
         site contains many trees with trunks more than 30 inches in diameter. These include
         two white oaks with trunks 45 inches in diameter, and a European beech with a trunk
         52 inches in diameter. Raoul Wallenberg Forest is also home to several densely vegetated
         areas of blackberries, wineberries, grapes, roses, black locust, sumac trees, and
         various wildflowers. Dozens of species of birds, including downy woodpeckers, red-tailed
         hawks, and white-throated sparrows, are also indigenous to the park.<br/><br/>
         In 1999, the Urban Park Rangers' Parks Conservation Corps worked alongside a forestry
         crew to re-open the staircase that had been overgrown with vegetation for years. Erosion
         control, trail maintenance, and native species plantings were also included in this
         project to improve Raoul Wallenberg Forest, a living tribute to a man who gave his
         life for the safety and survival of tens of thousands of others.<br/><br/>
