      <p><b>Description: </b>The Thomas Pell Wildlife Sanctuary makes up the westerly part of Pelham Bay Park (2,764
         acres). Included within its bounds are Goose Creek Marsh and the saltwater wetlands
         adjoining the Hutchinson River as well as Goose Island, Split Rock, and the oak-hickory
         forests bordering the Split Rock Golf Course. The area is home to a variety of wildlife
         including raccoon, egrets, hawks, and the occasional ibis or coyote. The Sanctuary
         is named for Thomas Pell, the first European to control the land. Pell signed a treaty
         with the Siwanoy, the Native American tribe that previously occupied this area, in
         1654, marking the first time a Briton owned significant property near Dutch New Amsterdam.<br/><br/>
         Pelham Bay Park. In 1966, plans were made to expand this landfill, which would have
         created the Cityâ€™s second-largest refuse disposal site next to Fresh Kills in Staten
         Island. These plans were met with widespread community opposition led by Councilmember
         Mario Merola, later Bronx District Attorney. The struggle resulted in the creation
         of the sanctuaries by a local law, signed by Mayor John V. Lindsay on October 11,
         1967.<br/><br/>
