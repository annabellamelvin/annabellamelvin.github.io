      <p><b>Park Name: </b>Forest Park Preserve
      </p>
      <p><b>Park ID: </b>Q015
      </p>
      <p><b>Borough: </b>Queens
      </p>
      <p><b>Acres: </b>274
      </p>
      <p><b>Description: </b>The Forest Park Preserve, in the eastern section of Forest Park is home to some of
         the last truly, undisturbed forest in New York City. This dense, mature oak forest
         is the largest continuous wooded area in Queens and contains many trees over 150 years
         old.  Along with towering oaks and a full compliment of hickory species (mockernut,
         pignut, bitternut, and shagbark), an understory of flowering dogwoods, mapleleaf viburnum,
         and a diverse herb layer on the forest floor complete the forest ecosystem.  The age
         and quality of this forest make it an ideal spot for birding, especially during the
         fall and spring migrations, when rarities such as cerulean, yellow-throated, and mourning
         warblers can be spotted.<br/><br/>
         Forest Park Preserve is also the location of a freshwater wetland restoration by Parksâ€™
         Natural Resources Group.  This spring, the Strack Pond restoration was completed and
         the site was re-dedicated in honor of Private First Class Lawrence George E. Strack
         (1948-1967), the first Woodhaven resident to die serving in the Vietnam War.  The
         Strack Pond project restored a kettle pond that formed as the last glacier withdrew
         from our region twenty thousand years ago.  Small kettle ponds teeming with emergent
         plants and shrubs once dotted the landscape of Forest Park, providing habitat for
         unique wildlife including salamanders, frogs, birds and other animals.  This habitat
         restoration brings back these invaluable natural resources and goes further.  The
         new construction includes a walking trail and viewing areas, making Strack Pond an
         important educational resource, and a prime site for bird, butterfly, and dragonfly
         enthusiasts.  Visitors to the site routinely see red-tailed hawks, great blue herons,
         and great egrets, which are supported by the newly restored and diverse ecosystem.
